# PID_Ball_Balancer
Final for a group project in ECE 3710 at the UofU. The project was a PID-controlled ball balancing system, written from scratch in Verilog based on an EECS 427 RISC processor designed and implemented on an FPGA.

Group: Tyler Liddell, Miguel Gomez, Rich Baird, Hryum Saunders.

All software and electrical systems designed and built by us. Credit to Josh Workman for much of the mechanical design and creation.

## Intro

This project, at the time of writing, was the most challenging project I've been a part of. It involved learning Verilog at a deeper level, understanding a RISC CPU architecture and ISA enough to realize it in Verilog, and putting many moving pieces of a system together in a working state. ![CPU](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69744715/153647981-636f586a-73ba-451a-a3e8-54008a1c6744.png)
